Description: E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate inference,
             including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and multi-sample tests for
             comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented. Measuring and testing
             multivariate independence based on distance correlation, partial distance correlation,
             multivariate goodness-of-fit tests, k-groups and hierarchical clustering based on energy 
             distance, testing for multivariate normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric 
             analysis of structured data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
