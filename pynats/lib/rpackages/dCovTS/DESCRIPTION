Description: Computing and plotting the distance covariance and correlation
             function of a univariate or a multivariate time series. Both versions
             of biased and unbiased estimators of distance covariance and correlation are provided.
             Test statistics for testing pairwise independence are also implemented. 
             Some data sets are also included.
