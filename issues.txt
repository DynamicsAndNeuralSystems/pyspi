## Issues

- You need `llvmlite`, which requires `LLVM 10.0.x` or `LLVM 9.0.x` and should be fine for most systems however in `arch` this needs to be installed via the AUR (`python-llvmlite`) or by installing `llvm10` using `pacman` (which will overwrite the latest version)
- Same for `PyTorch` (install with `python-pytorch`). If you cannot, then torch might be able to be installed via `pip`, however I would use the `--no-cache-dir` flag otherwise there's a `MemoryError` raised.
