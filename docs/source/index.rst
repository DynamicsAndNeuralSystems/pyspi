Welcome to PySPI's documentation!
===================================

**PySPI** (/pie'spy/) is a Python library for simultaneously evaluating hundreds of pairwise interactions directly from multivariate time-series data.

It provides easy access to over 250 methods for evaluating the relationship between pairs of time series, from simple statistics (like correlation coefficients and coherence) to advanced multi-step algorithms (like convergent cross-mapping and Granger causality).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`install` the project.
