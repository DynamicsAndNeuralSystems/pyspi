Version 1.5 (see release notes below)

JIDT provides a standalone, open source code Java implementation (usable in Matlab, Octave and Python) of information-theoretic measures of distributed computation in complex systems: i.e. information storage, transfer and modification.

This includes implementations for:
- both discrete and continuous-valued variables, principally for the measures transfer entropy, mutual information and active information storage;
- using various types of estimators (e.g. Kraskov-Stögbauer-Grassberger estimators, kernel estimation, linear-Gaussian).

Installation
=============

"Full" description of any required installation is at: https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/wiki/Installation

However, if you are reading this file, you've downloaded a distribution and you're halfway there!

There are no dependencies to download; unless:
 a. You don't have java installed - download it from http://www.java.com/
 b. You wish to build the project using the build.xml script - this requires ant: http://ant.apache.org/
 c. You wish to run the JUnit test cases - this requires JUnit: http://www.junit.org/ - for how to run JUnit with our ant script see https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/wiki/JUnitTestCases

Then just put the jar in a relevant location in your file structure.

That's it.

=============
Documentation
=============

A research paper describing the toolkit is included in the top level directory -- "InfoDynamicsToolkit.pdf".

A tutorial, providing background to the information-theoretic measures, various estimators, and then to the JIDT toolkit itself is included in the tutorial folder (see "JIDT-TutorialSlides.pdf" for the tutorial slides, and "README-TutorialAndExercise.pdf" for further description of the tutorial exercises).

Javadocs for the toolkit are included in the full distribution at javadocs.
They can also be generated using "ant javadocs" (useful if you are on a git clone).
Further, they will are posted on the web via links at https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/wiki/Documentation

The project wiki also contains further information on various aspects; see https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/wiki to start.

Further documentation is provided by the Usage demo examples below.

 h. demos/octave/NullDistributions --  investigating the correspondence between analytic and bootstrapped distributions for TE and MI under null hypotheses of no relationship; the demo is run under Octave or Matlab -- see description at https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/wiki/NullDistributions

 i. java/unittests -- the JUnit test cases for the Java toolkit are included in the distribution -- these case also be browsed to see simple use cases for the various calculators in the toolkit -- see description at https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/wiki/JUnitTestCases
