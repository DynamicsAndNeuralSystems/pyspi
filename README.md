_pyspi_ is a comprehensive python library for computing statistics of pairwise interactions (SPIs) from multivariate time-series (MTS) data.
The toolbox provides easy access to hundreds of methods for evaluating the relationship between pairs of time series, from simple statistics (like correlation) to advanced multi-step algorithms (like Granger causality).
The code is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (or later).

**Feel free to reach out for help with real-world applications.**

## Installation
The simplest way to get the _pyspi_ package up and running is to install the package locally using `pip`. 
For access to the full library of SPIs, the code requires GNU's [Octave](https://octave.org/download) be installed on your system.

#### 1. Pre-Install Octave (Optional)
While you can safely install _pyspi_ without first installing `Octave`, you will not have access to the full library of SPIs

#### 2. Create a conda environment (Optional, Recommended)
While you can also install _pyspi_ outside of a conda environment, it depends on a lot of user packages that may make managing dependencies quite difficult. 
So, we would also recommend installing pyspi in a conda environment. Firstly, create a fresh conda evironment:
```
conda create -n pyspi python=3.9.0
```
Once you have created the environment, activate it using `conda activate pyspi`.

#### 3. Install with pip
To install _pypi_ using a local pip install, download or clone the latest version from the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi
```

Once you have navigated to the main folder (`pyspi`), you can install using:
```
pip install .
```


For a more detailed guide on how to install _pyspi_, as well as how you can use _pyspi_ without first installing Octave, 
please see the [full documentation](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/installation/installing-pyspi).
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive [troubleshooting guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfehZqaCWnsSRDIdUG8/s/Iw3ORxNbDkeyBcdB5svU/installation/troubleshooting) for users who encounter issues installing _pyspi_ on their system,
as well as [alterantive installation options](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/installation/alternative-installation-options). 

## Getting Started

Once you have installed _pyspi_, you can apply the toolkit

### Walkthrough Tutorials
Now that you have



See the [documentation](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/) for installing and setting up _pyspi_.
Once you're done, you can learn how to use the package by checking out the:

- [Simple demo](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials/getting-started-a-simple-demonstration)
- [Tutorial (finance: stock price time series)](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials/finance-stock-price-time-series)
- [Tutorial (neuroimaging: fMRI time series)](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials/neuroimaging-fmri-time-series).

If you have access to a PBS cluster and are processing MTS with many processes (or are analyzing many MTS), then you may find the [_pyspi_ distribute](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi-distribute) repository helpful.

If your dataset is large (containing many processes and/or observations), you can use a pre-configured set of reduced statistics or create your own subsets (cf. the [documentation guide](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/advanced-usage/using-a-reduced-spi-set)).

## SPI Descriptions
To access a table with a high-level overview of the _pyspi_ library of SPIs, including their associated identifiers, see the [table of SPIs](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/spis/table-of-spis) in the full documentation.
For detailed descriptions of each SPI, as well as its associated estimators, we provide a full breakdown in the [SPI descriptions](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/spis/spi-descriptions) page of our documentation.

## Contributing to _pyspi_
Contributions play a vital role in the continual development and enhancement of _pyspi_, a project built and enriched through community collaboration.
If you would like to contribute to _pyspi_, or explore the many ways in which you can participate in the project, please have a look at our 
detailed [contribution guidelines](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/development/contributing-to-pyspi) about how to proceed.
In contributing to _pyspi_, all participants are expected to adhere to our [code of conduct](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfehZqaCWnsSRDIdUG8/s/Iw3ORxNbDkeyBcdB5svU/development/code-of-conduct).

### SPI Wishlist
We strive to provide the most comprehensive toolkit of SPIs. If you have ideas for new SPIs or suggestions for improvements to exisitng ones, we are eager to hear from and collaborate with you! 
Any pairwise dependence measure, provided it is accompanied by a published research paper, typically falls within the scope for consideration in the 
_pyspi_ library.
You can access our SPI wishlist via the [projects tab](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi/projects) in this repo to open a request.
