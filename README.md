_pyspi_ is a comprehensive python library for computing statistics of pairwise interactions (SPIs) from multivariate time-series (MTS) data.
The toolbox provides easy access to hundreds of methods for evaluating the relationship between pairs of time series, from simple statistics (like correlation) to advanced multi-step algorithms (like Granger causality).
The code is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (or later).

**Feel free to reach out for help with real-world applications.**
Feedback is much appreciated through [issues](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi/issues), or [pull requests](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi/pulls).

## Installation üì•
The simplest way to get the _pyspi_ package up and running is to install the package using `pip install`. 
For access to the full library of SPIs, the code requires GNU's [Octave](https://octave.org/download) to be installed on your system.

#### 1. Pre-Install Octave (Optional)
While you can safely install _pyspi_ without first installing `Octave`, you will not have access to the full library of SPIs

#### 2. Create a conda environment (Optional, Recommended)
While you can also install _pyspi_ outside of a conda environment, it depends on a lot of user packages that may make managing dependencies quite difficult. 
So, we would also recommend installing pyspi in a conda environment. Firstly, create a fresh conda environment:
```
conda create -n pyspi python=3.9.0
```
Once you have created the environment, activate it using `conda activate pyspi`.

#### 3. Install with _pip_
Using `pip` for [`pyspi`](https://pypi.org/project/pyspi/):
```
pip install pyspi
```

For a more detailed guide on how to install _pyspi_, as well as how you can use _pyspi_ without first installing Octave, 
please see the [full documentation](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/installation/installing-pyspi).
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive [troubleshooting guide](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/installation/troubleshooting) for users who encounter issues installing _pyspi_ on their system,
as well as [alternative installation options](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/installation/alternative-installation-options). 

## Getting Started üöÄ

Once you have installed _pyspi_, you can learn how to apply the package by checking out the [walkthrough tutorials](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials) in our documentation.  Click any of the examples below to access the tutorials in our full documentation:

- [Simple demonstration](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials/getting-started-a-simple-demonstration)

- [Finance: stock price time series](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials/finance-stock-price-time-series)


- [Neuroimaging: fMRI time series)](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/walkthrough-tutorials/neuroimaging-fmri-time-series)

### Advanced Usage
For advanced users, we offer several additional guides in the [full documentation](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/advanced-usage) on how you can distribute your _pyspi_ jobs across PBS clusters, as well as how you can construct your own subsets of SPIs. 
Click one of the following dropdowns for more information:

<summary>Distributing pyspi calculations</summary>
<p>If you have access to a PBS cluster and are processing MTS with many processes (or are analyzing many MTS), then you may find the <a href="https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi-distribute"><em>pyspi distribute</em></a> repository helpful.
In the full <a href="https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/advanced-usage/distributing-calculations-on-a-cluster">documentation </a>, we provide a comprehensive guide on how you can distribute <em>pyspi</em> calculations on a PBS cluster, along with the necessary scripts and commands to get started!</p>

<summary>Reduced subsets</summary>
<p>If your dataset is large (containing many processes and/or observations), you can use a pre-configured set of reduced statistics or create your own subsets.
Follow the guide in the <a href="https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/usage/advanced-usage/using-a-reduced-spi-set">documentation </a> to learn how you can create your own reduced subsets.</p>

## SPI Descriptions üìã
To access a table with a high-level overview of the _pyspi_ library of SPIs, including their associated identifiers, see the [table of SPIs](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/spis/table-of-spis) in the full documentation.
For detailed descriptions of each SPI, as well as its associated estimators, we provide a full breakdown in the [SPI descriptions](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/pyspi/spis/spi-descriptions) page of our documentation.

### SPI Wishlist
We strive to provide the most comprehensive toolkit of SPIs. If you have ideas for new SPIs or suggestions for improvements to existing ones, we are eager to hear from and collaborate with you! 
Any pairwise dependence measure, provided it is accompanied by a published research paper, typically falls within the scope for consideration in the 
_pyspi_ library.
You can access our SPI wishlist via the [projects tab](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pyspi/projects) in this repo to open a request.
