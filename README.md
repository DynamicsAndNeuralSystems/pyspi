# PyNATS
Python network analysis for time series

For installing:
- You need llvmlite, which requires LLVM 10.0.x or 9.0.x and should be fine for most systems however in arch-linux this needs to be installed via the AUR (python-llvmlite) or simply install llvm10
- Same for PyTorth (install with python-pytorch)
