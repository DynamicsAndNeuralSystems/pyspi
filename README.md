# Python Library of Statistics for Pairwise Interactions (pyspi)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5787486.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5787486)

*PySPI* is a comprehensive library for computing pairwise interactions from multivariate time-series (MTS) data.

The code provides easy access to hundreds of methods for evaluating the relationship between pairs of time series, from simple statistics (like correlation) to advanced multi-step algorithms (like Granger causality).
The code is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (or later).
